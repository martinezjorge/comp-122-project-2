Write an ARM program in ARMSim# that will do the following:

    Read the text from a file called "input.txt" as a string of characters
    Uppercase every consonant
    Replace all vowels with an asterisk (*)
    Output the new string from memory to a file called "output.txt"
    For example:
        "input.txt" contains "Blind love couldn't win as the facts all came in. But I know I'll again chase after wind. What have I got if not a thought?"
        "output.txt" should contain "BL*ND L*V* C**LDN'T W*N *S TH* F*CTS *LL CAME *N. B*T * KN*W *'LL *G**N CH*S* *FT*R W*ND. WH*T H*V* * G*T *F N*T * TH**GHT?"

Meeting the above requirements is a bare minimum for the assignment. In order to get full credit, your program should:

    have appropriate comments
    check for errors
    have a readable output

Please submit a single file called "project2.s" to the assignment.
